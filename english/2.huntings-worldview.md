Whenever the aurora appears, there will be many black giant islands in the far north of the extreme cold places. The ancient castles on each giant island are guarded by dragons all year round. The old people call these islands 「Wight Islands」. According to legend, the island is full of endless treasures. Warriors wearing dragon scale equipment can board the giant island, go to the castle to summon the dragon and obtain endless wealth, but no one has successfully returned.

Dragon scale fragments are magical treasures left by dragons on the mainland in ancient times. After being crafted by skilled craftsmen, they can be upgraded to magical swords, helmets, shields and other dragon scale equipment. The ancestors and tribes battled for the survival of the dragon scale fragments throughout the year, and only the survivors of the battle can obtain it.

Finally one day, you're so lucky got five pieces of dragon scale equipment, put them on, and go to the 「Wight Islands」 on the night when the aurora appears. Your story is about to begin……
