# 1. Project Background

HuntingNFT is an original GameFi project initiated by Nervos global community volunteers. It aims to continuously explore and create more Nervos-based public chains by combining infrastructures such as UniPass, mNFT, Dex, and NervosDao in the Nervos ecosystem, combined with the team's original gamification R\&D design、 P2E gameplay and value.&#x20;



In the HuntingNFT world, participants can obtain dragon scale equipment through battles and summon dragons to open garrison and sacrifice modes, or they can choose to go to 「 Wight Islands」 to unlock more sandbox world gameplay and continue to receive rich rewards.
