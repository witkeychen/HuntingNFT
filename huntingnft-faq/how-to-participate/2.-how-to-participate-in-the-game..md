# 2. How to participate in the game.

Deposit CKB to HuntingNFT's official wallet or buy Nervos-based NFTs on the secondary market, then you can participate in the game battle. Only one winner in each game can be rewarded.

In V1.0 Beta version, each Battle Grant winner can win NFTs from other players participating in the game, and all game participants have the opportunity to receive CKB rewards distributed by the game's Bonus Pool on that day.

In the upcoming V1.1-V2.0 version, players can obtain the dropped dragon scale equipment NFT through Battle Grant to summon the unique evil dragon NFT in the whole network. At the same time, players can participate in premium sales in the secondary, sacrifice, guardianship and other P2E gameplays.

In the planning of the next major version, players can go to "Wight Islands" to open the HuntingNFT sandbox world game by using the Dragon NFT as their identity certificate, and obtain corresponding PVE, PVP income and bonus.
